# ðŸŽ² Tic Tac Toe

> A TDD Workshop

## Introduction

This project contains a simple implementation of a [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game. We created it together but it's not yet finished. It's up to you to continue from this point and finish implementing the different parts of the game.

May the force be with you.

## So far we:

- Started off with E2E tests for a basic happy flow: From registration to a game between two players until the game is finished with first player winning the game.
- Moved code to new components and remove code duplication. Tests are still green âœ….
- Added simple validation logic to the registration phase and tested it with component tests.
- Refactored game logic to a separate function and tested it with unit tests.

### Now it's up to you to:

- Complete second player winning logic.
- Complete game logic (rows, columns, diagonals, and tie).
- What happens when you click an already occupied cell?
- Show the player currently playing in bold.
- Show the name of the player who won when the game is finished. What happens in case of a tie?
- Hide registration form when game starts.
- Hide game during registration.
- What happens if you enter the name "a"? That doesn't sound like a normal name. Make sure you only allow players with normal names ðŸ˜ˆ.
- Finished before time? Bored? Implement a save game logic (to local storage). How whould you test it? You could also choose to save each win to a leaderboard table.
- Finished the previous task? ðŸ˜§ Add an option to play against the computer. Implement AI algorithm, so that the computer will never loose. How would you test it?

<p align="center"><strong>Woohoo! You're done! ðŸ˜€</strong></p>
